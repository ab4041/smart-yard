### About Project
This project aims to create a robust system for real-time monitoring and management of logistics operations. By leveraging advanced technologies, it provides:


- Continuous data capture and processing.
- Real-time insights and automated reporting.
- Enhanced operational efficiency and security.
 The system uses high-resolution cameras for real-time visual monitoring of trucks and cargo. It employs advanced image analysis algorithms to extract critical information, such as truck identifiers, license plates, and cargo details. This data is continuously processed, logged, and reported to improve operational efficiency, security, and compliance.

- **Truck Tracking & Identification**: Automatically tracks trucks within a yard, extracting details such as:
  - License number
  - Truck ID
  - Trailer ID
  - Trailer size
  - Current status
  - Precise location
  
- **Docking Status Monitoring**: Identifies truck docking status at pods, providing live updates on goods being loaded or unloaded.

- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects anomalies such as:
  - Punctured trailer wheels
  - Open doors
  - Potential thefts

- **Automated Data Logging**: Converts monitored video data into textual data, stored in a database for easy retrieval and analysis.

- **Enhanced Operational Efficiency**: Improves productivity, product quality, safety, and overall operational efficiency in supply chain management.

This solution leverages existing CCTV cameras, GPS, and RFID scanners to provide real-time insights and improve logistics operations.

### System design and technical implementation (HLD)

<br>

The architecture includes data capture via cameras and IoT sensors, real-time processing with AI models, and storage in cloud databases. Itâ€™s designed for scalability with load balancers, ensuring efficient data handling and system resilience during varying operational workloads.

### Data Capture
- **Camera Setup**: Install and configure high-resolution cameras at strategic locations within the yard.
- **Capture**: Use OpenCV for precise tracking, focusing on key objects like trucks and cargo.

### Data Processing and Storage
- **Storage**: Data is stored in cloud data lakes (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks, Oracle) for large-scale analysis.
- **Real-Time Processing**: AI models (e.g., SageMaker, Metaflow) and computer vision tools (e.g., OpenCV, YOLO v8, Ultra Analytics) are used for processing real-time data.

### Image Processing
- **Pre-Processing**: Utilize OpenCV for resizing, filtering, and normalizing images.
- **Object Detection**: Implement YOLO models for identifying and tracking trucks and cargo.
- **Text Extraction**: Use OCR tools (e.g., EasyOCR) to read license plates and cargo labels.

### Data Management
- **Log Storage**: Extracted data (e.g., truck IDs, cargo details) is stored in a structured format in a database.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Utilize a streaming platform for real-time data processing and analysis.

### Integration
- **APIs**: Develop APIs for seamless integration with existing logistics software and dashboards.
- **User Interface**: Create intuitive dashboards for visualizing data and managing system operations.

### Deployment and Maintenance
- **Deployment**: Use cloud services or on-premises servers for deploying the application.
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring tools to track system performance and facilitate maintenance.

### Output and Storage
- **Processed Data Storage**: Processed data, including videos and logs, is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Insights**: This data is used to generate insights on truck traffic, loading/unloading times, and more.

### Scalable System
- **Load Balancing**: A load balancer adjusts processing resources dynamically to handle varying workloads efficiently.
